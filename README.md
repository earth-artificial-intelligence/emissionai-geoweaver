# emissionai-geoweaver
This workflow is generated by Geoweaver to replicate the experiments done in [EmissionAI's](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/3/729#) published article. Currently the workflow retrieves the data from an already compiled source, but the next version will make this workflow retrive data from the different data sources directly.

TODO:
1. Complete TROPOMI & EPA direct data source extraction.
2. Fix Matplotlib error when generating SVR Model visualization.
3. Update LSTM model, and fix current error.
4. Add a final node to evaluate all previous model performances.
